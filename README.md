# Synopsis

This program is meant to take in a music playlist link or file with one or more songs and create a new playlist with only the songs appropriate for children. Even though songs may not be marked explicit, they can still have inappropriate references to things such as drugs, violence, etc. Those who use this program should still verify that each outputted playlist has appropriate songs based on their best judgement and lyric verification if needed, but given a playlist with a mix of inappropriate and appropriate songs, it should reduce the time it takes to check manually.
